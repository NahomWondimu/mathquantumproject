## Project Idea
Using quantum simulations to model environmental changes to find sustainable practices that could make it better.

---

## Background
Quantum simulations use the principles of quantum mechanics to simulate complex systems more efficiently than classical computers. In environmental science, modeling phenomena such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution can be computationally intensive. Quantum simulations have the potential to provide more accurate and faster predictions, helping us understand and address these issues.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore how quantum computing can contribute to environmental sustainability. By modeling environmental changes more precisely, we can develop better strategies for conservation, pollution management, and sustainable development. This project aims to connect quantum computing with real-world applications in environmental science.

## Quantum Computing Foundations

### Qubits  
Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, a **qubit** can exist in a superposition of both states. This property enables quantum computers to represent multiple possibilities simultaneously.

### Superposition & Entanglement  
- **Superposition**: A qubit can hold a combination of states, allowing many calculations in parallel.  
- **Entanglement**: Two or more qubits can become correlated in ways impossible classically, enabling complex simulations of interactions.  

### Quantum Gates  
Quantum gates manipulate qubits, similar to how logic gates act on classical bits:  
- **Hadamard (H)**: Creates superposition.  
- **Pauli-X**: Flips |0⟩ to |1⟩ (like a NOT gate).  
- **CNOT**: Entangles two qubits.  

These gates form the building blocks of circuits that simulate physical systems.

## Environmental Simulations with Quantum Circuits

### Why Simulate?  
Environmental models — from climate systems to pollution spread — often require tracking countless interacting variables. Classical computers struggle with scaling because resources grow exponentially. Quantum systems naturally represent and evolve these complex interactions.

### Example Applications  
- **Climate Models**: Use quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo methods for more accurate forecasts.  
- **Deforestation Impact**: Model ecosystem loss using quantum optimization to evaluate intervention strategies.  
- **Pollution Spread**: Simulate diffusion processes with quantum walks to study pollutant dispersion in air or water.

## Methods & Tools

### Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)  
Hybrid algorithms like the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** and **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** are promising for near-term devices. They approximate solutions to large, complex systems using small quantum circuits plus classical optimization loops.

### Frameworks Used in Research  
- **Qiskit** (IBM) — open-source SDK for circuits and algorithms.  
- **Cirq** (Google) — Python library for NISQ devices.  
- **PennyLane** — bridges quantum hardware with machine learning tools.  

### Example Code (2-Qubit Circuit)
```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, transpile, execute

qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)            # Superposition on first qubit
qc.cx(0, 1)        # Entangle with second qubit
qc.measure_all()   # Measure both qubits

sim = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
compiled = transpile(qc, sim)
result = execute(compiled, sim, shots=1024).result()
print(result.get_counts())
