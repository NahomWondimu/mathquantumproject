# Quantum Simulations for Environmental Sustainability

## Project Idea
Using quantum simulations to model environmental changes and improve sustainability practices.

## Background
Quantum simulations use the principles of quantum mechanics to simulate complex systems more efficiently than classical computers. In environmental science, modeling phenomena such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution can be computationally intensive. Quantum simulations have the potential to provide more accurate and faster predictions, helping us understand and address these issues.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to explore how quantum computing can contribute to environmental sustainability. By modeling environmental changes more precisely, we can develop better strategies for conservation, pollution management, and sustainable development. This project aims to connect quantum computing with real-world applications in environmental science.
